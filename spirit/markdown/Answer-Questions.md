# 如何更好地回答

&emsp;&emsp;态度和善一点。问题带来的压力常使人显得无礼或愚蠢，其实并不是这样。

&emsp;&emsp;对初犯者私下回复。 对那些坦诚犯错之人没有必要当众羞辱，一个真正的新手也许连怎么搜索或在哪找 FAQ 都不知道。

&emsp;&emsp;如果你不确定，一定要说出来！ 一个听起来权威的错误回复比没有还要糟，别因为听起来象个专家好玩就给别人乱指路。要谦虚和诚实，给提问者与同行都树个好榜样。

&emsp;&emsp;如果帮不了忙，别妨碍。 不要在具体步骤上开玩笑，那样也许会毁了用户的安装──有些可怜的呆瓜会把它当成真的指令。

&emsp;&emsp;探索性的反问以引出更多的细节。 如果你做得好，提问者可以学到点东西──你也可以。试试将很差的问题转变成好问题，别忘了我们都曾是新手。

&emsp;&emsp;尽管对那些懒虫报怨一声“读读该死的手册”（RTFM）是正当的，指出文档的位置（即使只是建议做个谷歌关键词搜索）会更好

&emsp;&emsp;如果你决意回答，给出好的答案。 当别人正在用错误的工具或方法时别建议笨拙的权宜之计，应推荐更好的工具，重新组织问题。

&emsp;&emsp;请回答真正的问题！如果提问者已经做了自己该做的研究，并且说明尝试过 X，Y，Z，A，B 与 C 都没有得到想要的結果，那么回复 试试 A 或 B 或者给出一个内容为 试一下 X，Y，Z，A，B 或 C 的链接将极其无益！

&emsp;&emsp;帮助你的社区从中学习。当回复一个好问题时，问问自己 如何修改相关文件或 FAQ 文档以免再次解答同样的问题？，接着再向文档维护者发一份补丁。

&emsp;&emsp;如果你是在研究一番后才做出的回答，展现你的技巧而不是直接端出结果。毕竟“授人以鱼，不如授人以渔”。



# How To Answer Questions in a Helpful Way

&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;*Be gentle.* Problem-related stress can make people seem rude or stupid even when they're not.

&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;*Reply to a first offender off-line.* There is no need of public humiliation for someone who may have made an honest mistake. A real newbie may not know how to search archives or where the FAQ is stored or posted.

&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;*If you don't know for sure, say so!* A wrong but authoritative-sounding answer is worse than none at all. Don't point anyone down a wrong path simply because it's fun to sound like an expert. Be humble and honest; set a good example for both the querent and your peers.

&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;*If you can't help, don't hinder.* Don't make jokes about procedures that could trash the user's setup — the poor sap might interpret these as instructions.

&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;*Ask probing questions to elicit more details.* If you're good at this, the querent will learn something — and so might you. Try to turn the bad question into a good one; remember we were all newbies once.

&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;While muttering RTFM is sometimes justified when replying to someone who is just a lazy slob, a pointer to documentation (even if it's just a suggestion to google for a key phrase) is better.

&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;*If you're going to answer the question at all, give good value.* Don't suggest kludgy workarounds when somebody is using the wrong tool or approach. Suggest good tools. Reframe the question.

&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Answer the actual question! If the querent has been so thorough as to do his or her research and has included in the query that X, Y, Z, A, B, and C have already been tried without good result, it is supremely unhelpful to respond with “Try A or B," or with a link to something that only says, “Try X, Y, Z, A, B, or C.".

&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;*Help your community learn from the question.* When you field a good question, ask yourself “How would the relevant documentation or FAQ have to change so that nobody has to answer this again?" Then send a patch to the document maintainer.

&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;If you did research to answer the question, *demonstrate your skills rather than writing as though you pulled the answer out of your butt.* Answering one good question is like feeding a hungry person one meal, but teaching them research skills by example is showing them how to grow food for a lifetime.
